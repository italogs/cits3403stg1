Javascript:

I've created a javascript file called js/scripts.js. It contains methods related to form validations,
redirect pages and html components(layout) on javascript level.
For example, the page register.html validates all fields. Specifically, the email field is validated
using regular expression to ensure the correct use the field.
All fields of register.html show a error message if the data has not been provided or wrongly inserted.


CSS:

There is a file called css/styles.css where it has been implemented all main css styles of the website.
However, in some pages, e.g. register.html, we can find some css written on file.
Most files have inline css written.


Form Controls:

When the user makes a valid register in the website, it shows a successful message to the user.
Examples of form controls: register.html, contact.html and login.html.


DHTML:

An example of using DHTML is presented in the function getFooter() 
in js/scripts.js. This function builds the whole footer, which is composed by
HTML text and a javascript call. It is responsible to get the file last modified date.


Final Comments:

- The website is valid for HTML 5 and CSS 2.1. Each page has a own link to check its validation through the images provided on the footer.

- After the user registers valid data on register.html, the website will show a success message to the user. However, there is no user session implemented due to the website has only static pages.
The same applies to when the user tries to log in.

About website's structure:

-I have created an image that represents the whole website and its hierarchical structure.
